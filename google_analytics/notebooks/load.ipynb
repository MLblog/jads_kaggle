    "There are a number of categorical features with many different values. This is an issue, specifically in the cases where those categorical features are not ordinal, and therefore label encoding them does not make sense. The only choice we are left with, is OHE. However naively performing this step would add hundreds of columns for each original categorical feature - in the end yielding potentially thousands of super sparse features. What I would like to explore, is whether there exist **specific values** with predictive value significantly higher than average. For example, looking at the particular country might be a weak predictor. However there might be 5 specific countries with a huge revenue deviation from the average (and enough samples to consider this discrepancy statistically significant)."
